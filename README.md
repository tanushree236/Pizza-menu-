A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

This project opens a Pizza menu. There is a animation at the starting for the lists of Pizza and the title. There are various types of pizza items.
On clicking a specific type of pizza the description of the pizza, number of slice, price and the address details are shown.
There is a option to like the specific type of pizza with a small animation on the like button.

The concepts that I have learnt in this project are:
1. Built-in Animation
2.Tween Animation
3.Hero Animation
4.Mixins in Dart
5.Animation Controllers
6.Tween Sequences
7.Animation Lists
8.Stagger List Animation
